After using the 3 different text editors I have decided the I like Nano the
best mostly because of the common commands on the bottom of the screen and the 
help was very helpful. The other ones I had to google how to do things but in Nano 
I was able to find what I needed within the program itself. One thing I liked about
Emacs was the option to open multiple buffers at once. I was curious to find out if
that could be done as well in Nano. With some help I was able to find that when you open
nano, before you do anything, type meta F and it gives you the ability to open multiple
buffers that way I didn't have to exit nano every time I wanted to open a new buffer.
